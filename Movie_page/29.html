                    <h3>Times of India</h3>
                    <p>"A lot of the events in 24 happen mainly on account of accidents and coincidences, but it is to Vikram Kumar’s credit that we buy into those scenes so willfully in this novel and entertaining, but definitely over-long, film that constantly charms us or leaves us thrilled with its inventiveness. The film begins with one such accident when an eagle acts a catalyst for Dr Sethuraman’s (Suriya) invention — a time machine. He is a famed watchmaker and inventor, living contentedly with his wife Priya (Nithya Menen) and their son. But his look-alike twin brother Athreya is smarting at his success and plans to have the time machine, which is in the form of a watch, for himself. But Sethuraman manages to save both his son and his invention by giving up his own life.

                    <h3>Baradwaj Ranjan</h3>
                    <p>"In his review for The Hindu, critic Baradwaj Rangan called 24 an "intelligent, joyous mix of sci-fi and masala-myth."[35] Sreedhar Pillai in his review for Firstpost mentioned, "24 is a classy commercial entertainer, which has its moments."[36] Malini Mannath of The New Indian Express wrote, "Attractively packaged, 24 is refreshing, novel and worth a watch."[37] M. Suganth of The Times of India, assigned 4 out of 5 stars, stating: "It is not often that we see a big star choosing to take a risk with a script that is not simplistic or formulaic, especially when his last few films have underperformed at the box office, but here Suriya pulls it off admirably."</p>
