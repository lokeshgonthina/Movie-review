                    <h3>Times of India</h3>
                    <p>"Kanchana, the sequel of the masala film (with a touch of horror), Muni, isn't very different from its prequel. As if using the same Kollywood masala formula wasn't bad enough, Kanchana sticks to an already existing template. The result is a fairly entertaining horror-comedy with the comic aspect, by far, eclipsing the so-called horror aspect.

                    <h3>IMDb Featured review</h3>
                    <p>"Choreographer-actor-director Raghava Lawrence’s “Kanchana” is a sequel to his earlier film “Muni”. Though the film is supposed to be a horror one, it succeeds to scare only in bits. For most part, the characters are loud, dramatic and over emotive."</p>
                    <h3>Melvin Solomon</h3>
                    <p>"Raghava (Lawrence) is a happy go lucky guy, who lives with his mother (Kovai Sarala) and his brother’s family. He fights and dances, but has just one weakness — he is afraid of the dark and ghosts, after sunset. Once, after a game of cricket with friends, he comes home to see that the cricket stumps have blood stains on them. From then, strange things happen in his house. Raghava begins to behave unusually, like a woman.."</p>
