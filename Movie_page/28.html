                    <h3>Times of India</h3>
                    <p>"On the whole, Jathi Rathnalu is an enjoyable comedy caper filled with multiple fun elements. It has slapstick comedy and logic goes for a toss. Also, the story and narration take a back seat but the tongue-in-cheek humor, satirical scenes, and solid punches dominate the show
                        <br/></p>
                    <h3>IMDb Featured review</h3>
                    <p>"Extremely Humorous Movie and Hilarious single liners...
                      The only roller coaster u will keep laughing throughout the ride...
                      The three on screen ratnas are fabulous and Naveen is Fabulously awesome...His performance feels like as if he is talking to us directly standing beside us.That natural he is and that perfect he is.. He wil be one of the finest actors in film industry."</p>
                    <h3>Melvin Solomon</h3>
                    <p>"The comedy do have a way to tickle and even performance by each one is good, but the story doesn't have any strength. They should have worked on the story more in depth. The trailer definitely has those quirky elements to draw your attention expecting something really worth to watch, but since it doesn't have any character arc or story arc it sort of picks up at many places but fails in each time. It felt like it was written in no sequence or idea of what's going on. It's more just written on what comedy skit can be made in this situation kind off. So only I call it Failed opportunity"</p>
